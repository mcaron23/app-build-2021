# Snack app

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack).

This is a school project, meant to have multiple screens and pictures. It's made with React Native and it's pretty simple, it just has a few "character" slides and that's it. The characters and art are made by myself :)
